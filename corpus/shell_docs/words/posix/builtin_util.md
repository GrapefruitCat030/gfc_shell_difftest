### 1.6 Built-In Utilities

Any of the standard utilities may be implemented as regular built-in utilities within the command language interpreter. This is usually done to increase the performance of frequently used utilities or to achieve functionality that would be more difficult in a separate environment. The utilities named in [Regular Built-In Utilities](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap01.html#tagtcjh_18) are frequently provided in built-in form. All of the utilities named in the table have special properties in terms of command search order within the shell, as described in [*Command Search and Execution*](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_18_09_01_01).
